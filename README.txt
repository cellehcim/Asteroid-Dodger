Enhancements added:
- Ship health + bar
- Score + Level on the screen (although it takes longer for the game to load)
- A level system -> determines min/max asteroid size and speed (they get bigger and faster as the game progresses)

Not technically enhancements but...
- New font (in Comic Sans!) that loads in the background.
- Custom Game Over screen with some flavour text and a statistic on how many asteroids the player avoided.
